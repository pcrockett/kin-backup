Accessing Private Content
=========================

You can use one of the programs in this directory to access the private content in this backup. Since {{owner}} didn't know ahead of time what kind of computer you will be using, you will need to select the program that will run on your computer:

* If you are currently using a Windows computer, double-click on `decrypt-windows.exe`
* If you are currently using a Linux computer, run `decrypt-linux`
<!-- TODO: * If you are currently using an Apple Macbook / OSX computer, run `decrypt-osx` -->

If you are unsure what kind of computer you have, you can either (a) seek help from someone with more computer expertise, or (b) just try double-clicking on all of the programs until one of them asks you for a passphrase.

Remember, {{owner}} gave this same backup to several people. When you are prompted for a passphrase, you will need one of the _other_ backup holders to enter _their_ passphrase. Your own passphrase won't work here.
